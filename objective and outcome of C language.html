	<p style="font-size: 25px;">1.<i>C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972.  It is a very popular language, despite being old. C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.</i></p>
	<p style="font-size:25px;">2.<i>The C language is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. It provides a straightforward, consistent, powerful interface for programming systems. That's why the C language is widely used for developing system software, application software, and embedded systems.</i></p>
	<h2 style="color:red;">Objective of C Language:</h2>
	<p style="font-size:25px;"><i>1. To understand computer programming and its roles in problem solving.<br/>
        2. To understand and develop well-structured programs using C language</i></p>
    <h2 style="color:red;">Outcomes of C Language:</h2>
    <p style="font-size:25px;"><i>CO1-
    Write compile and debug Programs in C language.<br/>
    CO2-
    Use operators, data types and write programs.<br/>
    CO3-
    Select the best loop construct for a given problem.<br/>
    CO4-
    Design and implement C programs.</i></p>
    <p style="font-size:30px; color:red;">I divided C Language into 5 different units.They are:-</p>
